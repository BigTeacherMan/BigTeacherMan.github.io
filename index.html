            Hello! My name is Curtis Dunford, otherwise known as the BigTeacherMan by my students.
            I am a husband, father, weightlifter, gamer, cinephile, and I am a former high school teacher that
            gave classes on HTML/CSS/JavaScript, Python, and Java. After teaching for some time, I am now looking 
            to enter the field of programming -- I am ready to do instead of teach. Teaching the subject matter
            has certainly given me the chance to learn how to code, and I am looking to apply the skills I have
            picked up in a professional setting. Below you will see examples of my work and ways to contact me.
        </p>

   <div id="samples">
        <h1 id="python" class="headers">Python</h1>
        <img id="chambers_icon" src="images/chambers_icon_title.png" alt="Chambers Logo">
        <a id="chambers_link" href="https://github.com/BigTeacherMan/Chambers"><img id="chambers_image" class="image_hover" src="images/chambers_menu_scene.png" alt="Chambers Menu"></a>
        <h2 id="chambers_name">Chambers</h2>
        <p id="chambers_summary">This is a game I started developing in October of 2023. I had a student ask if
            it's possible to create a Russian Roulette video game. Kind of an odd inquiry, 
            but this was my introductory Python class. I took this as a challenge and I 
            started coding a Russian Roulette game that eventually garnered the name: "Chambers". 
            This is certainly a work in progress, but it has taught me much about how to code
            better in Python and what to expect when working on a program that will be exported. 
            I have also been fortunate to include one of my old students on this project. He, 
            Issac Robertson, has done all of the artwork for this project and has done a tremendous 
            job. This has given me the chance to oversee a project and work with others to get it done.

        <h2 id="challenge_name">Coding Challenge</h2>
        <p id="challenge_summary">This was my first foray into the realm of c#. What was 
            described as "easy" and "simple" became an overwhelming goliath of a challenge
            as I realized my Python mind only knew so much when it came to this unfamiliar
            coding language. New keywords, modules/library, syntax, and including a semicolon
            and the end of every line of code was frustrating at the least, but it was
            envigorating at the most. Taking on this coding challenge reignited my desire
            to learn how to code and c# is my new target. This code is certainly going to look
            like it came from the hand of a beginner, but I will get better.
